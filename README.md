# ourstreet
rebuilding community, one street at a time

The first step is to get to know each other. Who lives in our street? What are their main occupation?
We are inviting the people in our street to fill out a form (paper or online).

We need a way to collect and share the answers with everyone. Hence the idea of ourstreet.brussels (you can of course fork this open source project and deploy it on your own domain).

## Other features that would be nice to have at some point
- List all the things that we have together
- List all the services that we can offer
- [Local Exchange Trading System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system)
